# E-commerce Conversion Funnel & Retention Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes user behavior on an e-commerce website to identify conversion drop-offs and retention patterns. The analysis focuses on how users move from product views to purchases and how engagement changes over time.

## Project Artifacts
- **📊 [Google Spreadsheet – Analysis & Calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KjBeZMZerpPYEbjJx_XBPkSxZ-XG4JFDrXceNrnnbDg/edit?usp=drive_link)**

## Key Analyses
### Conversion Funnel
- Tracked unique users across three stages: product view → cart → purchase  
- Only **29%** of viewers opened a cart  
- Only **36%** of cart users completed a purchase  
- Overall conversion rate was approximately **10%**

### Retention Analysis
- Grouped users into monthly cohorts based on first purchase  
- Month-1 retention ranged from **4%–12%**
- Retention dropped sharply after Month 1, reaching near zero by Month 3–4  
- Earlier cohorts showed slightly better retention than later cohorts

## Tools Used
- Excel (Pivot Tables, helper columns, funnel & cohort calculations)

## Key Takeaways
- Major drop-off occurs before cart engagement  
- Retention declines quickly after the first purchase  
- Results suggest opportunities to improve onboarding, cart experience, or post-purchase engagement
